Once, in a bucolic expanse crowned with golden fields, there was a farm named Whistler's Meadow. Here lived a rather peculiar chicken named Daisy. Unlike her fellow cluckers, Daisy bore an ethereal shimmer to her feathers, which glistened like morning dew under the soft caress of sunlight. Her plumage was a whirlwind of colors; a captivating display of azure, emerald, and gold, painting her as the peacock of the henhouse. Daisy carried her head high, with eyes like black marbles glistening with wisdom beyond her years. Her comb stood, a regal red crown atop her head. A satin sheen bathed her slender, graceful neck, where feathers whispered and rustled in time with a gentle breeze.
