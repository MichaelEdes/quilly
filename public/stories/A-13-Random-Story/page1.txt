In the heart of the Wilderglade, a forest undreamt by the ordinary world, lived a peculiar creature named Jorbin. Wildeglade was a vibrant tapestry of life, where rainbows curled like lazy serpents around enchanted trees, and the air was filled with the soft hum of ancient magic. Jorbin, a Glinny—a sprite of remarkably small stature with wings as iridescent as dragonfly filaments—spent his days exploring the glade, cataloguing secrets known only to its mystical inhabitants.

One morning, as sunlight filtered through the canopy like golden syrup, Jorbin discovered a peculiar footprint, larger than any creature should dare leave. This set his heart aflutter with both fear and curiosity. His eyes, the color of honeyed amber, widened as he scribbled notes into a notebook larger than himself. White curls of hair escaped the crown of his leaf-tangled cap, testament to his age and wisdom, though his spirit was as youthful as a spring breeze.
