In the heart of the Wilderglade, a forest undreamt by the ordinary world, lived a peculiar creature named Jorbin. Wildeglade was a vibrant tapestry of life, where rainbows curled like lazy serpents around enchanted trees, and the air was filled with the soft hum of ancient magic. Among its unusual inhabitants, Jorbin was the most extraordinary — a diminutive Spriggan, with eyes the color of pine needles and skin as bark-like as a wintered oak. His arms and legs were slender twigs, but his heart was vast and industrious. Jorbin tended the Wilderglade’s emerald heart, nurturing saplings with songs only the trees could hear. His hair, a wild mane of moss and lichen, was home to a family of fireflies. When the sun's last rays kissed the canopy, the fireflies illuminated him, making Jorbin glow like a soul caught between dusk and dawn.
