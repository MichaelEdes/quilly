In a forgotten corner of the world, atop a ghastly cliff that snapped at the very skies, stood a lair that even daylight dared not embrace. It belonged to a villain so steeped in deceit that truth itself fled his presenceâ€”a man known only as Malifer. The lair, a misshapen keep chiseled into jagged rocks, loomed like a grotesque silhouette against the storm-haunted horizon. Its walls, cloaked in moss and shadows, seemed to writhe as if alive with dark secrets.

Malifer himself was as twisted as his abode. His hair was the color of coal, slicked back against a scalp the hue of pale parchment. His skin, tinged a sickly gray, seemed to absorb all light, rendering him a spectral figure visible only by the malevolent gleam in his icy eyes. He moved with the slithering grace of a serpent, each step quiet as a lie whispered in the night.
