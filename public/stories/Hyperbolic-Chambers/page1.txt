In a time long forgotten, a scientist named Elias Frost stood at the heart of an ambitious experiment. With unruly curls of jet-black hair and piercing gray eyes that seemed to mirror storm clouds, Elias was a man of science and secrets. His skin, a pale canvas, spoke of nights spent under the cold gaze of fluorescent lights rather than sunlit days. One cold evening, shrouded in the dim glow of his underground lab, he entered the Cryogen Chamber, encased within a realm of unyielding frost.

Elias awoke to chaosâ€”a cacophony of unfamiliar noises echoing in the vast emptiness around him. As he grappled with the chamber's release mechanisms, the cold uncoiled its icy grip. A millennium had passed since he first closed his eyes, the world outside reshaping itself in ways he could never have imagined.
