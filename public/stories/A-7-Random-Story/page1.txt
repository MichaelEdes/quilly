Eli stood at the edge of the Forgotten Valley, gazing at the vast, undulating waves of lavender mist that hovered over the land. The valley was notorious for its mysterious happenings and eerie silence, except for the whispers that locals claimed haunted the area. Eli was determined to uncover its secrets.

The path into the valley was lined with trees twisting in grotesque shapes, their skeletal branches reaching out like bony fingers. Each step deeper felt like entering another world, where time seemed irrelevant. The air was heavy with the scent of wild magnolias, and the distant sound of water trickling somewhere below the mist was ever present.
