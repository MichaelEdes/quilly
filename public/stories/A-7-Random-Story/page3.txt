Eli nodded, though a knot of fear twisted in his stomach. The woman gestured towards the archway, and as he passed through, the mist parted to reveal a world untouched by timeâ€”majestic ruins covered in ivy, a sky sparkling with countless stars, and a river of liquid light snaking through the landscape. It was both breathtaking and unsettling, a place out of dreams and nightmares alike.

Eli realized this valley was not just forgotten, but a refuge for lost souls and untold histories. Around him, spectral figures floated, each carrying their tale of woe or triumph in silence. It was a realm where whispers were memories, and memories had weight. In this place, Eli discovered the depth of his courage and the power of understanding the echoes of those who came before.
