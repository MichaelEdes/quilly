Perched upon the ancient boughs of a gnarled oak sat Otus, a magnificent owl, whose feathers were a tapestry of earth tones—rich browns and soft tans, mottled with flecks of white. His eyes were orbs of liquid amber, perceptive and all-seeing, with tufts crowning his head reminiscent of noble horns. Robust and agile, Otus’s wingspan stretched wide, feathers ruffling gently with the night breezes, ever alert to the rustlings of the forest.

But on this night, an instinctive tension hung heavy in the air, and Otus felt an unfamiliar chill tickle his razor-sharp talons. His sharp beak and formidable fangs twitched with unease as he sensed a predator of a different shade.

Lucian emerged from the shadows, his predatory gaze locked on the owl, a mischievous smile curling on his lips. "Dear Otus," he whispered, "tonight, your blood sings a siren song."
