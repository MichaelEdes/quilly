Deep in the heart of an ancient, shadow-drenched forest, where the moonlight barely whispered through the thick canopy, a creature of the night stirred with a ravenous hunger. This was no ordinary vampire—he had the appearance of a man, yet was ageless as time. His name was Count Lucian Styrr, a being with skin as pale as marble, contrasting starkly with his long, silky black hair that draped like a shroud over his shoulders. His eyes were a piercing crimson, glowing with a burning intensity that seemed to pierce the soul of any who dared meet his gaze. Lucian's frame was tall and slender, his movements a balance of elegant grace and predatorial swiftness, draped in a dark velvet cape that fluttered like the wings of a night creature in the dusky breeze.

But tonight, his thirst sought a different prey, more exotic than simple human blood. His quarry was the wise denizen of the night skies—a great horned owl.

The moonlight dappled the forest floor in silver puddles as Lucian moved with silent purpose, his presence a mere ghost in the shadowy depths.
