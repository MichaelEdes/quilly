In a quaint little town, where the winds always dwell,
Lived a curious chap named Oliver Snell.
His house was blue with a roof painted red,
And he wore green pajamas whenever to bed.

One fine morning, as Oliver sipped tea,
He heard a tap, tap—a visitor—oh, who could it be?
With a hop and a trot, he scampered to the door,
Wondering who might be visiting on this floor.

The door swung wide, and there stood a sight,
A peculiar creature in the morning's first light.
With fur so fluffy, in shades of bright pink,
And eyes like saucers that gave a slow wink.

"Good day," chirped the creature with a voice of glee,
"I am Blimpy Boo, visiting places like thee."
Oliver gawked at the stripes of bright green,
Running all down Blimpy, the tallest he'd seen.

They entered the house, with tea cups in hand,
Talking of skies and of magical lands.
For hours they chatted about rhymes and things blue,
And time seemed to fly as the friendship grew.

As the sun went to bed and the stars came to play,
Blimpy Boo said, "Well, I mustn't delay.
But I'll be back soon, on that you can bet,
For a visitor at the door brings joy, never fret."

And with a bounce and a leap, Blimpy left the floor,
Leaving Oliver grinning, waiting for more.
In a world full of stories and adventures to spin,
A visitor at your door is where it begins.
