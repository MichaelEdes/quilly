In the twilight of ambition, where reason battled against the confines of nature, Jack heard the lamentable hum of his own hubris. For months, he had delved deep into the forbidden corridors of genetic manipulation, driven by a relentless thirst for discovery. The lizard—a simple yet profound creature—became the muse for his groundbreaking serum. It was to be a revolutionary breakthrough, one that would unveil the secrets of regeneration and vitality.

Yet, as the hour struck midnight, a storm of malevolent energy engulfed the lab. Instruments sparked, their dials spinning frantically. Poisonous smoke coiled around Jack, wrapping him in a cocoon of calamity. He writhed in agony, his very being contorted beneath the vise of his own transgression.

Emerging from the haze was not the man he once was, but a creature reborn of nightmare and science. The betrayal of his own hands left him stranded on the threshold between humanity and something far more sinister. As he staggered through the ghostly silence of the laboratory, Jack’s mind flickered between lucidity and feral instincts.

Beneath the pallor of a gibbous moon, Jack McScaley wandered into the night—no longer the master of his destiny, but a prisoner ensnared by his own creation. The howl of a distant wolf lingered, swallowed by the nocturnal void. Jack’s heart, still part human, echoed its sentiment—a solitary cry for deliverance in the vast wilderness of consequence.
