In the heart of the Wilderglade, a forest undreamt by the ordinary world, lived a peculiar creature named Jorbin. Wildeglade was a vibrant tapestry of life, where rainbows curled like lazy serpents around enchanted trees, and the air was filled with the soft hum of ancient magic. Among its unusual inhabitants, Jorbin was the most extraordinary — a diminutive Spriggan, with eyes the color of pine needles and skin as bark-like as a wintered oak. His arms and legs were slender twigs, but his heart was vast and industrious.

Jorbin tended the Wilderglade’s emerald heart, a luminous grove where the roots sang gently to the forgotten moonlit sky. His home was nestled in the crook of an old willow, its verdant leaves cascading down like nature's own drapery. Here, the atmosphere shimmered, flecks of golden dust floating lazily in beams of sunlight, painting an ethereal charm over everything.
