High atop the glistening peaks of Frost Mountain, there existed a kingdom made of ice, where the sparkling turrets of Castle Glacium shone brightly under the Northern Lights. In this chilly, magical land, King Glacious ruled with both warmth and wisdom, despite the freezing temperatures surrounding him. King Glacious, with his icy-blue skin that shimmered like freshly fallen snow, icy white hair, and an elegant, long robe of twinkling icicles, was known for his kindness. His large, sky-blue eyes sparkled with the enthusiasm of adventure and discovery, which led him to invent marvelous things in his palace laboratory.

One such invention was Robo-Rice, a cheerful, round-shaped robot with a metallic body gleaming like polished silver. His antenna glowed with a steady light, which changed colors when he processed thoughts or emotions. Robo-Rice had tiny wheels for feet, allowing him to glide speedily across the icy floors, and a chirpy voice that echoed with glee.

One chilly morning, King Glacious looked out his frosted balcony window to witness an icy storm approaching. But there was a puzzle as well; within the snowstorm, a rainbow arched mysteriously. It was then King Glacious decided that this was the sign of an adventure calling, and he invited Robo-Rice to accompany him.
