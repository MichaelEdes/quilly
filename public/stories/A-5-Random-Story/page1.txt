Elara Moonshadow moved silently through the Whispering Woods, her senses entwined with the gentle murmur of the forest. Each step carefully measured, her footfalls barely disturbed the blanket of fallen leaves. She had always found solace in these woods, a sanctuary from the burdens of her world. The trees whispered secrets to those who listened, and Elara’s pointed ears were attuned to these ancient murmurs. Today, however, the whispers carried urgency, an undercurrent of anxiety gnawing at her peaceful sanctuary.

As she glided past pools of moonlight filtering through the canopy, she felt the presence of another – a long-anticipated arrival. She turned, her silver hair catching the luminescence. Emerging from a copse of shadows was Finnian Bramble. A grin split his bearded face as he adjusted the satchel slung across his shoulder, its contents clinking melodiously.

“Lass, ye look like trouble's found ye already,” Finnian said, chuckling as he tugged at his beard.

A smile tugged at Elara’s lips. “It’s not trouble, Finnian; it’s the Woods. They’re whispering of changes, something stirring.”

Finnian’s grin softened as concern flickered across his emerald eyes. “The Woods don’t jest,” he replied, his voice tinged with respect for the land he loved.

Elara nodded. “We must seek Sorcha. Her insight into these mysteries might illuminate the path we must tread.”
