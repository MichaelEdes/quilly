The relentless clicking of keyboards filled the air as the finance department of Hastings Corporation hummed with efficiency. Amidst neat rows of desks adorned with family photos and potted plants, a gentle buzz of conversations blended with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Alice Morgan sat at her cubicle, her blonde hair cascading in soft waves down her shoulders. With a fair, porcelain-like complexion and bright blue eyes hidden beneath a pair of rectangle glasses, she exuded a quiet elegance. Her attire was professionally modest, a soft lavender blouse contrasting against a charcoal pencil skirt.

Next-door, James Bennett meticulously tapped keys at his own desk. His tousled chestnut hair coupled with a rugged, slightly tanned complexion gave him an effortless charm. Deep-set hazel eyes were framed by the edge of black-rimmed glasses. Jamesâ€™s signature attire was a crisp white shirt rolled up to his elbows, under a navy waistcoat.

Their office space was designed to promote productivity, with open desks separated by glass partitions, allowing light to pour in from large windows that offered a sweeping view of the city skyline. The walls sported muted earth tones and occasional abstract art pieces.

They had known each other for years, exchanging smiles and occasional conversations over coffee runs. Their friendship was like a seed germinating beneath the surface, eager for sunlight to coax it into life.
