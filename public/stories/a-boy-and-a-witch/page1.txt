Once upon a time, nestled at the edge of an ancient, whispering forest sprawled the quaint village of Cold Hollow. In this quiet enclave lived an ever-curious boy named Oliver.

Oliver had tousled, chestnut brown hair that curled around his ears, hinting at his untamed spirit. His eyes were wide, twinkling hazel orbs that constantly flickered with inquisitiveness. His skin was the color of sun-kissed sand, dotted with freckles like stars scattered across the night sky.

One crisp autumn morning as golden leaves pirouetted from the trees, Oliver set off for the forest. As luck would have it, he wandered deeper than ever before. Here, amidst the towering oaks and between woven curtains of ivy, he stumbled upon a peculiar cottage seemingly stitched together by the forest itself.

Before he could turn away, the door creaked open as though it had been expecting him. Out stepped a witch. Her name was Selene.

Selene had a graceful presence, almost regal, with sharp, celestial features. Her hair cascaded like a waterfall of silver, shimmering with every slight of movement, and her skin was as pale as moonlit snow. Her eyes glowed with an emerald intensity, reflecting a wisdom surpassing countless ages, and her slender, ethereal fingers carried the secrets of the arcane.

With a knowing smile, she invited Oliver into her home, a sanctuary adorned with trinkets of old magic. Despite his initial hesitation, his curiosity triumphed.
